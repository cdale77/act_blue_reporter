# ActBlueReporter

This is a Ruby gem designed to simplify getting contribution information from
ActBlue. It is designed to work across multiple ActBlue campaigns. 

It is not a full-fledged wrapper for the ActBlue API; it doesn't do much more
than retrieve data. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'act_blue_reporter'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install act_blue_reporter
